# 14.1. Web Applications
'''
In this chapter, you will learn how to create web applications in Python.
There are two kinds of web applications – “client side” web applications
and “server side” web applications. You’ve probably used both kinds in
your travels on the World-Wide Web.

Client-side web applications are programs that are downloaded to a web
browser and executed on the user’s local machine. Client-side applications
are typically written in JavaScript and embedded in web pages.

Server-side web applications are programs that run on web server computers,
rather than on the user’s local machine. Typically, a server-side web
application displays a form with text boxes and other data collection
mechanisms. The user fills out the form, clicks a submit button, and the
browser sends the form to the web application on the server, which processes
the request, and responds with another web page. If you’ve ever shopped
online, you’ve used a server-side web application.

In this chapter, you will learn to build server-side web applications,
which I will refer to simply as “web applications.”
