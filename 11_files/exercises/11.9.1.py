for each student in an imaginary class. The studentâ€™s name is the
first thing on each line, followed by some exam scores.
The number of scores might be different for each student.

Using the text file studentdata.txt write a program that prints out
the names of students that have more than six quiz scores.

    items = aline.split()
    if len(items[1:]) > 6:
        print(items[0])
