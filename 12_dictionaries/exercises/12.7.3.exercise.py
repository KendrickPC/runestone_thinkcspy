'''
Write a program called alice_words.py that creates a text file named
alice_words.txt containing an alphabetical listing of all the words,
and the number of times each occurs, in the text version of Aliceâ€™s
Adventures in Wonderland. (You can obtain a free plain text version
of the book, along with many others, from http://www.gutenberg.org.)
The first 10 lines of your output file should look something like this:

    Word        Count

    a           631
    a-piece     1
    abide       1
    able        1
    about       94
    above       3
    absence     1
    absurd      2
