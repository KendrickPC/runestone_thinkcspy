# 8.5 The 3n+1 Sequence

'''
As another example of indefinite iteration, letâ€™s look at a sequence that has fascinated mathematicians for many years. The rule for creating the sequence is to start from some positive integer, call it n, and to generate the next term of the sequence from n, either by halving n, whenever n is even, or else by multiplying it by three and adding 1 when it is odd. The sequence terminates when n reaches 1.

This Python function captures that algorithm. Try running this program several times supplying different values for n.
