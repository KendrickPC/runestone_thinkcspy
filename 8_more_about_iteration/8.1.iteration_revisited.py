# 8.1. Iteration Revisited
'''
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks.
Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors
is something that computers do well and people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called iteration.
Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language
features to make it easier. We’ve already seen the for statement
in a previous chapter. This is a very common form of iteration in
Python. In this chapter we are going to look at the while
statement — another way to have your program do iteration.
