# 1. Use a for statement to print 10 random numbers.

import math
import random

random_numbers_needed = 10

for i in range(random_numbers_needed):
    random_generator = random.random()
    print(random_generator)


# 2. Repeat the above exercise but this time print 10 random numbers between 25 and 35, inclusive.


# 3. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is related to the lengths of the other two sides. Look through the math module and see if you can find a function that will compute this relationship for you. Once you find it, write a short program to try it out.


# 4. Search on the internet for a way to calculate an approximation for pi. There are many that use simple arithmetic. Write a program to compute the approximation and then print that value as well as the value of math.pi from the math module.
