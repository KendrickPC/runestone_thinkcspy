# 2.11 Updating Variables

x = 6
print(x) # <<< 6
x = x + 1
print(x) # <<< 7

'''
If you try to update a variable that doesnâ€™t exist, you get an error because
Python evaluates the expression on the right side of the assignment operator
before it assigns the resulting value to the name on the left. Before you can
update a variable, you have to initialize it, usually with a simple assignment.
In the above example, x was initialized to 6.

Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment; subtracting 1 is called
a decrement. Sometimes programmers also talk about bumping a variable, which
means the same as incrementing it by 1.
