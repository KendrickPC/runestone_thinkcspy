# 17.7. Objects as Arguments and Parameters

'''
You can pass an object as an argument in the usual way. Weâ€™ve already
seen this in some of the turtle examples where we passed the turtle to
some function like drawRectangle so that the function could control and
use whatever turtle instance we passed to it.

Here is a simple function called distance involving our new Point
objects. The job of this function is to figure out the distance
between two points.
'''


import math

class Point:
    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY

    def getX(self):
        return self.x

    def getY(self):
        return self.y

    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5


def distance(point1, point2):
    xdiff = point2.getX() - point1.getX()
    ydiff = point2.getY() - point1.getY()

    dist = math.sqrt(xdiff ** 2 + ydiff ** 2)
    return dist

p = Point(4, 3)
q = Point(0, 0)
print(distance(p, q))


'''
distance takes two points and returns the distance between them.
Note that distance is not a method of the Point class. You can see
this by looking at the indentation pattern. It is not inside the class
definition. The other way we can know that distance is not a method of
Point is that self is not included as a formal parameter. In addition,
we do not invoke distance using the dot notation.
