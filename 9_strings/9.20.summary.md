# 9.20 Summary

### This chapter introduced a lot of new ideas. The following summary may prove helpful in remembering what you learned.

##### indexing ([])
Access a single character in a string using its position (starting from 0). Example: 'This'[2] evaluates to 'i'.

##### length function (len)
Returns the number of characters in a string. Example: len('happy') evaluates to 5.

##### for loop traversal (for)
Traversing a string means accessing each character in the string, one at a time. For example, the following for loop:

	for ix in 'Example':
	    ...
executes the body of the loop 7 times with different values of ix each time.

##### slicing ([:])
A slice is a substring of a string. Example: 'bananas and cream'[3:6] evaluates to ana (so does 'bananas and cream'[1:4]).

##### string comparison (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
The six common comparision operators work with strings, evaluating according to lexigraphical order. Examples: 'apple' < 'banana' evaluates to True. 'Zeta' < 'Appricot' evaluates to False. 'Zebra' <= 'aardvark' evaluates to True because all upper case letters precede lower case letters.

##### in and not in operator (in, not in)
The in operator tests whether one string is contained inside another string. Examples: 'heck' in "I'll be checking for you." evaluates to True. 'cheese' in "I'll be checking for you." evaluates to False.
